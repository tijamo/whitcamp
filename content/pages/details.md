      This year we're back in the hugely popular site  in Leicestershire at
      Grace Dieu Manor, near Ashby


      **The Site**

      The new site is at a private football academy and includes all of our
      usual facilities, large camp area, Swimming Pool, Sports Hall and
      classrooms. Its located a few minutes from Junction 23 of the M1 with
      hotel accommodation close by. ***They've even fixed the showers!!***


      **Activities**

      We will be camping in the school grounds and we have a marquee for meals
      and communal activities, - the marquee is where the main camp activities
      take place. Full information and programme details will be sent following
      receipt and acceptance of your booking, nearer the time.


      There is a variety of spiritual, sporting, craft and family activities
      arranged over the course of the long weekend. There will be time to
      explore our Camp Theme and plenty of relaxation time.


      Morning and evening activities tend to be communal and the afternoons a
      chance to follow activities of your choice - tennis, football, swimming,
      Bible studies, walks, crafts etc. In addition we normally have a mix of
      late night singing and lighter evening entertainment.


      **Numbers are limited to around 400 so book early to avoid
      disappointment.**


      Children who attend Sunday School, CYC & YPGs are welcome to attend.


      **Accommodation and catering**

      Bring either a tent or a caravan or campervan - in addition we're hoping
      to be able to use some limited on-site accommodation, although this is
      still to be confirmed. This is expected to be at a premium and we may need
      to give priority to those in particular need. Some people find a local
      guesthouse accommodation more convenient, but you will need to book it
      early. All meals are provided at camp; groups of people will be rostered
      to prepare meals to pre-planned menus. Toilet and shower facilities are
      available.


      **Children's and Young People's activities**

      Organised sports and games normally include football, rounders, volleyball
      and netball. There are swimming sessions in the heated indoor pool and the
      Meal-a-Day Tuck Shop is always popular so bring some change.

      There will be a quiet (unsupervised) revision room for those with exams
      coming up.

      And for teenagers with a lot of energy, we will be organising 'late night
      in the gym' sessions.


      **Parents and Sponsoring**

      Those under 18 who are not coming with a parent, must be sponsored by a
      suitable adult who will be at camp. If you need to be sponsored, please
      make sure you approach the person who is sponsoring you well in advance so
      that they can include you in their booking.


      Parents and Sponsors - the safety and conduct of children and under 18s
      remain your responsibility whilst at Camp. The Committee takes issues of
      under-age and/or excessive drinking, and any use of banned substances at
      Whit Camp extremely seriously. We expect parents and/or sponsors to play
      an active role in accepting their responsibilities and help the Committee
      to address any concerns that may arise.


      If you wish to sponsor someone but have already completed an online
      booking form, please get in touch with Joyce (see contacts page).


      **Safety**

      Please be aware of the dangers concerning the swimming pool, surrounding
      land, main roads, public footpaths and sports facilities, kitchen area and
      cooking range, all of which could pose a serious hazard. Dogs will be
      allowed but must be controlled, always on leads and kept away from food
      areas, and poop-scoops must be used.


      All campers should note the out-of-bounds areas. We have a ‘No Bicycle
      rule’, so please leave them at home.

      We cheerfully assume that, as you want to come, you will happily join in
      with the programme of activities and with the Christian spirit of Whit
      Camp. We look forward to seeing you!


      The Committee takes everyone's safety and security seriously and for this
      reason we are fully insured, carry out risk assessments for the weekend
      and have Data Protection and Safeguarding Polices which can be downloaded
      below.
