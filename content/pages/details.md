    text: "This year we've secured a new site back in Leicestershire at Grace Dieu Manor, near Ashby.\_\n\n**The Site**\nThe new site is at a private football academy and includes all of our usual facilities, large camp area, Swimming Pool, Sports Hall and classrooms. Its located a few minutes from Junction 23 of the M1 with hotel accommodation close by.\n\n**Activities**\nWe will be camping in the school grounds and we have a marquee for meals and communal activities, - the marquee is where the main camp activities take place. Full information and programme details will be sent following receipt and acceptance of your booking, nearer the time.\n\nThere is a variety of spiritual, sporting, craft and family activities arranged over the course of the long weekend. There will be time to explore our Camp Theme and plenty of relaxation time.\n\nMorning and evening activities tend to be communal and the afternoons a chance to follow activities of your choice - tennis, football, swimming, Bible studies, walks, crafts etc. In addition we normally have a mix of late night singing and lighter evening entertainment.\n\n**Numbers are limited to around 400 so book early to avoid disappointment - we are planning to open bookings soon.**\n\nChildren who attend Sunday School, CYC & YPGs are welcome to attend.\n\n**Accommodation and catering**\nBring either a tent or a caravan or campervan - in addition we're expecting to be able to use some limited on-site accommodation. This is expected to be at a premium and we may need to give priority to those in particular need. Some people find a local guesthouse accommodation more convenient, but you will need to book it early. All meals are provided at camp; groups of people will be rostered to prepare meals to pre-planned menus. Toilet and shower facilities are available.\n\n**Children's and Young People's activities**\nOrganised sports and games normally include football, rounders, volleyball and netball. There are swimming sessions in the heated indoor pool and the Meal-a-Day Tuck Shop is always popular so bring some change.\nThere will be a quiet (unsupervised) revision room for those with exams coming up.\nAnd for teenagers with a lot of energy, we will be organising 'late night in the gym' sessions.\n\n**Parents and Sponsoring**\nThose under 18 who are not coming with a parent, must be sponsored by a suitable adult who will be at camp. If you need to be sponsored, please make sure you approach the person who is sponsoring you well in advance so that they can include you in their booking.\n\nParents and Sponsors - the safety and conduct of children and under 18s remain your responsibility whilst at Camp. The Committee takes issues of under-age and/or excessive drinking, and any use of banned substances at Whit Camp extremely seriously. We expect parents and/or sponsors to play an active role in accepting their responsibilities and help the Committee to address any concerns that may arise.\n\nIf you wish to sponsor someone but have already completed an online booking form, please get in touch with Joyce (see contacts page).\n\n**Safety**\nPlease be aware of the dangers concerning the swimming pool, surrounding land, main roads, public footpaths and sports facilities, kitchen area and cooking range, all of which could pose a serious hazard. Dogs will be allowed but must be controlled, always on leads and kept away from food areas, and poop-scoops must be used.\n\nAll campers should note the out-of-bounds areas. We have a ‘No Bicycle rule’, so please leave them at home.\nWe cheerfully assume that, as you want to come, you will happily join in with the programme of activities and with the Christian spirit of Whit Camp. We look forward to seeing you!\n\nThe Committee takes everyone's safety and security seriously and for this reason we are fully insured, carry out risk assessments for the weekend and have Data Protection and Safeguarding Polices which can be downloaded below.\n"
